to do: once or 
she had
peeped 
the book her sister 
reading, but it had

in it, "and what is

Alice,

down what

or she fell very 
for she had
plenty 
time as she went 
to look about her, 
to wonder what
was 
to happen next. 
she tried to look 
and make out
what 
was coming to, but 
was too dark to see 
then she
looked at 
sides of the well 
noticed that they 
filled 
and book-shelves: 
and there she saw 
and pictures
hung 
pegs. She took down 
jar from one of the

passed; it 
labelled "ORANGE

it

had learnt 
of this sort in her 
in the schoolroom, 
though this
was 
a _very_ good 
for showing off her

there was no

it was good 
to say it
over)

distance--but then

she jumped up on to 
feet in a

all dark overhead; 
her was another 
and the White

down it.
There was 
a moment to be 
away went Alice 
the wind, and
was 
in time to hear it 
as it turned a

it when she
turned 
corner, but the 
was no longer to be 
she found
herself 
a long, low hall, 
was lit up by a row 
lamps hanging
from 
roof.

There were 
all round the hall, 
they were all 
and when
Alice had 
all the way down 
side and up the 
trying every
door, 
walked sadly down 
middle, wondering 
she was ever 
out 
she came upon a 
three-legged table, 
made of 
there was nothing 
it but a tiny 
key, and Alice's 
was that this might 
to one of the doors 
the hall; 
either the locks 
too large, or the 
was too small, but 
rate it would not 
any of them. 
on the second 
she came upon a low 
she had not noticed 
and
behind it was 
little door about 
inches high: she 
the
little golden 
in the lock, and to 
great delight it 
opened the door and 
that it led into a 
passage, not
much 
than a rat-hole: 
knelt down and 
along the 
the loveliest 
you ever saw. How 
longed to get out 
dark hall, and 
about among those 
of bright flowers 
cool fountains, but 
could not even get 
head through 
"and even if my 
would go through," 
poor Alice,

things had happened 
that
Alice had 
to think that very 
things indeed were 
seemed to be no use 
waiting by the 
door, so she 
to the table, half 
she might find 
key on it, or 
rate a book of 
for shutting people 
like telescopes: 
she found a little 
on it ("which 
was not 
said Alice,) and 
round the neck of 
bottle was a 
with the words 
ME" beautifully 
on it in 
was all very well 
say "Drink me," but 
wise little Alice 
going to do _that_ 
a hurry. "No, I'll 
first," she said, 
whether it's marked 
or not;" for she 
read several
nice 
stories about 
who had got burnt, 
eaten up by
wild 
and other 
things, all because 
_would_ 
the simple rules 
friends had taught 
such as, that 
poker will burn you 
you hold it too 
and that, if 
your finger _very_ 
with a knife, it 
bleeds; and 
never forgotten 
if you drink much 
a bottle 
it is almost 
to disagree with 
sooner or 
this bottle was 
marked "poison," so 
ventured to
taste 
and finding it very 
(it had, in fact, a 
of mixed
flavour 
cherry-tart, 
pineapple, roast 
coffee, and
hot 
toast,) she very 
finished it 
* * * * *

"What 
curious feeling!" 
Alice. "I must be 
up like 
so it was indeed: 
was now only ten 
high, and her

she was now the 
size for 
that little door

to herself, "in my

what the flame of 
looks like after 
candle is blown 
for she could 
ever having seen

After a 
finding that 
more happened, she 
on going
into the 
at once; but, alas 
poor Alice! when 
got to the
door, 
found she had 
the little golden 
and when she
went 
to the table for 
she found she could 
possibly reach
it: 
could see it quite 
through the glass, 
she tried her
best 
climb up one of the 
of the table, but 
was too 
when she had tired 
out with trying, 
poor little 
down and 
there's no use in 
like that!" said 
to herself,
rather 
"I advise you to 
off this minute!" 
generally
gave 
very good advice 
she very seldom 
it), and
sometimes 
scolded herself so 
as to bring tears 
her
eyes; and once 
remembered trying 
box her own ears 
having
cheated 
in a game of 
she was playing 
herself,
for this 
child was very fond 
pretending to be 
people.
"But it's 
use now," thought 
Alice, "to pretend 
be two people!
Why 
hardly enough of me 
to make _one_ 
person!"

Soon 
eye fell on a 
glass box that was 
under the

in it a very small 
on which the

marked in currants. 
I'll eat it," 
"and if it makes me 
larger, I can reach

me grow smaller, I 
creep under the

into the garden, 
I don't care which

said anxiously to 
"Which way?

top of her head to

to find that she

sure, this is what 
happens when one 
cake,
but Alice 
got so much into 
way of expecting 
but
out-of-the-way 
to happen, that it 
quite dull and 
life to go on in 
common way.

So 
set to work, and 
soon finished off 
cake.

Just 
her head struck

key and hurried off

on. "I must be

surprised to

thought. "I must

up and went to the

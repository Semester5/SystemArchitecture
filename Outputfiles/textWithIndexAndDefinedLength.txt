_Down the 
ALICE was beginning 
get very tired of 
by her sister on 
bank, and of having 
to do: once or 
she had peeped into 
book her sister was 
but it had no 
or conversations in 
"and what is the 
of a book," thought 
"without pictures 
conversations?" So 
was considering in 
own mind (as well 
she could, for the 
day made her feel 
sleepy and stupid) 
the pleasure of 
a daisy-chain would 
worth the trouble 
getting up and 
the daisies, when 
a White Rabbit with 
eyes ran close by 
There was nothing 
_very_ remarkable 
that; nor did Alice 
it so _very_ much

Rabbit say to

she thought it over

a tunnel for some 
and then dipped 
down, so suddenly 
Alice had not a

herself before she

what seemed to be a 
deep well. 
Either the well was 
deep, or she fell 
slowly, for she had 
of time as she went 
to look about her, 
to wonder what was 
to happen next. 
she tried to look 
and make out what 
was coming to, but 
was too dark to see 
then she looked at 
sides of the well 
noticed that they 
filled with 
and book-shelves: 
and there she saw 
and pictures hung 
pegs. She took down 
jar from one of the 
as she passed; it 
labelled "ORANGE 
but to her 
it was empty; she 
not like to drop

to herself. "After

sort in her lessons

to say it over)

And ever as the story drained 112
And ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont 1974
And everythings curious today I think I may as well go in at once 2122
And everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near here 2526
And faintly strove that weary one 114
And half believe it true 110
And have grown most uncommonly fat 1256
And he added in an undertone to the Queen Really my dear witness 3330
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to that ridiculous fashion 3214
And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very any more 882
And here very like a mouse you know But do cats eat bats I wonder 296
And home we steer a merry crew 123
And how Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on 1725
And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly 2770
And how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice in a hurry to 2753
And how odd the directions will look presents to ones own feet 441
And I declare its too bad that it is 539
And Ill tell himit was for Yes it is his business said Five 2162
And I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone 2936

And pour the waters of the Nile 504
AND QUEEN OF HEARTS procession came THE KING 2194
And she began is who in the world am I Ah thats the great puzzle 483
And she began thinking over other rather a handsome pig I think 1678
And she But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone 1313
And she kept on at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad 778
And she opened the door and went in perfectly idiotic 1539
And she rabbit I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next 926
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as you can find it 2485
And shes such a capital one for catching mice you Dinahs our cat 868
And shes such a Page she changed to shes 3654
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a what I should be like then 377
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must 439
And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face 371
And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making 984
And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw go on 2056
andthats all the first figure said the Mock Back to land again 2827
And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve creatures 3103
And the executioner went off like an arrow 2444
And the Gryphon never learnt it stiff 2742
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw 1272
And then Leave off that screamed the Queen You make me giddy 2241
And Then the Dormouse shall they both cried Wake up Dormouse 1996
And the Please come back and finish your story Alice called after it 851
And those long words and whats more I dont believe you do either 697
And took them quite away 3147

And who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question said the 864
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark 2981
And with a gentle hand 127
And with that she began nursing her child again singing a figures 1608
And yesterday things went on just as usual queer everything is today 479
And yet I dont trouble you know as we neednt try to find any 3518
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youd about it 587
And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant 1135

could have been changed for any of them herself to see if she 485
could have told you that any shrimp 2920
could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She nearer Alice 2638
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends 3608
could hear the very tones of her voice and see that up into hersshe 3600

could if I only knew how to begin shut up like a telescope I think I 337
could If you do Ill set Dinah at you called out as loud as she 1071

could not make out that the poor little juror it was Bill the Lizard 3134
could not possibly reach went back to the table for it she found she 384
could not remember ever having heard like the three gardeners but she 2197
could not saying Thank you sir for your interesting story but she 2662
could not see anything that the flowers and the blades of grass but she 1144
could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and 3132
could not swim But said I 3478
could not swim you cant swim can you he added said I 3521
could not taste confusion as the large birds complained that they 763
could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers the pack she 2217
could not think of any Here was another puzzling question and as Alice 1211

could see her after the birds Why cant think And oh I wish you 869
could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her it she 385
could see it trying in a helpless other side of the garden where Alice 2408
could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates Alice 3398
could see when she looked down was were nowhere to be found all she 1356
could show you our cat Dinah I think youd about it And yet I wish I 587
could speak again Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice 2687
could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said I 2942
could that she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there 1671
could The games going on rather better now she said by way as she 2492
could think of it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he 1880
could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess Alice 2440

goodnatured she The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked 1687
good opportunity for making her escape so she This seemed to Alice a 1131
good opportunity for repeating his The Footman seemed to consider this a 1530
good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as was not a very 273
good practice to say it there was no one to listen to her still it was 274
good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very 1212
good school said the Mock Turtle in a Ah then yours wasnt a really 2704

had been looking at Alice Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He 1824
had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a Alice 1884

had been Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who 2828
had been wandering when a sharp hiss made of the trees under which she 1370

had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise than what you 2537
had begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog 2316
had begun to think that very few things indeed were really Alice 339
had brought herself down to nine inches high house till she 1456
had but to open them again and all would change to though she knew she 3618
had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight By the time she 2411
had changed his mind and was coming eagerly half hoping that the Mouse 885
had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a The Dormouse 2097
had come back It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it 1753
had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the he 2447
had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go her life and 545
had Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she 251
had entirely disappeared so the he had come back with the Duchess it 2447
had expected before she had It did so indeed and much sooner than she 945
had fallen into a from which she concluded that it was just possible it 1003
had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo birds and animals that 625
had felt quite unhappy at the thing she said to herself for she 2610
had finished saying anything more till the Pigeon 1389
had finished this short speech they all cheered thimble and when it 755
had first spoken What for said the one who 2158
had fits my dear I think he said to she had this fit you never 3538
had flown into her face and her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon 1371
had fluttered down from the trees upon her face leaves that 3577
had followed him into the The Hatter looked at the March Hare who 3164
had forgotten the little golden key and when she door she found she 383
had found her way into a tidy little room with a table By this time she 934
had found the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she 920
had gone remained some time after the rest of it 1773
had gone through that day the number of changes she 1412
had got burnt and eaten up by nice little stories about children who 353
had got her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she 2311
had got its head down and was going to out laughing and when she 2315
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but but Alice 411
had got to the fifth I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly you 835
had grown in the last few minutes and she the moment how large she 3349
had grown so large in If any of them can explain it said Alice she 3508
had grown to her full size by Who cares for you said Alice she 3567
had grown up she said to trot quietly away into the wood If it 1676
had happened exactly as if nothing 1517
had happened lately that For you see so many outoftheway things 338
had happened So she began again O est ma chatte which anything 577
had hoped a fan and two or three pairs in the window and on it as she 935
had hurt Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she 580
had in fact a sort of mixed taste it and finding it very nice it 362
had It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she 945
had its full effect Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now 960
had it written down but I cant quite follow it as you say it I 2540
had just begun Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle 3060
had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in was dozing off and 301

had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high 2129
had learnt several thousand miles down I think for you see Alice 271
had left her leaning her head BUT her sister sat still just as she 3593
had left off sneezing by this time Dont grunt grunted in reply it 1653
had left off writing on his as she spoke The unfortunate little Bill 3542
had looked under it and on both sides of it and herself and when she 1147
had lost something and she looking anxiously about as it went as if it 897
had made her so to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that 2464
had made mistake it 912
had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to As soon as she 1647
had made the whole party look so grave and anxious remark that 2438
had meanwhile been examining the roses I see said the Queen who 2251
had neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent She 1367

had not noticed before and round she came upon a low curtain she 326
had not pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water 734
had not the smallest idea arranged the only difficulty was that she 1105
had no very clear notion how long ago her knowledge of history Alice 576
had now had its full effect Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle 960

had sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she 218
had some kind of authority looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it 2964
had some one to listen to her The Cat seemed to think that there she 2349

hands and feet at the three gardeners oblong and flat with their 2184
hands and feet to make the themselves up and to stand upon their 2304
hands and remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her 1440

hands how is it I cant see you shoulders got to And oh my poor 1361

herself down to nine inches high house till she had brought 1456

herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the thing she said to 2610
herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the to keep 1121
herself glass table Now Ill manage better this time she said to 2126

herself How can you learn Oh you foolish Alice she answered 980
herself How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to 2506
herself how she would manage it They must And she went on planning to 439
herself how this same little sister of hers Lastly she pictured to 3627

herself in a Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to 297
herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself cheated 395
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging 313
herself in a melancholy I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah she said to 879
herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder Alice to 376
herself in the long hall and close to the little Once more she found 2125
herself in Wonderland So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed 3617
herself I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial to 3369
herself I There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to 1073
herself Its the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk to 2339
herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes 1677
herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily thought to 1314
herself lying on the bank with her tried to beat them off and found 3575
herself nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised 1784
herself not in a very hopeful tone When Im a Duchess she said to 2467
herself Now I of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to 957
herself Now what am I to do with Alice was just beginning to think to 1669
herself out with trying the poor little thing and when she had tired 387
herself slipped in like 561
herself so severely as to bring tears into her sometimes she scolded 393
herself still in existence and sudden change but very glad to find 534
herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all timidly saying to 1786
herself talking familiarly with them as if she had to Alice to find 643
herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so to 2464
herself Thats quite enoughI hope I down the bottle saying to 948
herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting and said to 1761
herself then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found 2130
herself Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to 1546
herself the way all the creatures argue dreadful she muttered to 1527
herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to saying to 1054
herself to Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped 2040
herself to be going messages for a How queer it seems Alice said to 925
herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them 485
herself up and said very gravely I think short remarks and she drew 1204
herself up closer to Alices side as you can find it And she squeezed 2485
herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the She stretched 1151
herself useful and looking A knot said Alice always ready to make 840
herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and gave 392
herself what such an extraordinary way Alice tried a little to fancy to 2024
herself whenever I eat or drink anything so Ill just see said to 941
herself Which way Which She ate a little bit and said anxiously to 407
herself Why theyre only a pack of cards after but she added to 2211
herself Why they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldnt be in 1047
herself with one of the against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned 1136
herself you know said the Mouse But she must have a prize 743
her sentence three of the players to be passion She had already heard 2400
her sharp little Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of 2555
her she began in a low timid voice If you please Rabbit came near 473
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and 3574
her she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out 1000
her She is such a dear quiet take a fancy to cats if you could only see 588
her shoulders changed into alarm in another moment when she found that 1355
her side She was Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at 2276
her sister kissed her and said It was a curious dream finished 3585
her sister sat still just as she had left her leaning her head BUT 3593
her sister was reading but it had no pictures or peeped into the book 219
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead head in the lap of 3576
her sister Why what a long sleep youve Wake up Alice dear said 3579
her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the edge of 3351
hers Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of 3627
her so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open 1348
her something about the games now tone tell 2773
her something worth hearing For some perhaps after all it might tell 1228
her sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into 393
her so she took courage and went on again and not to 1563
her so to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made 2464
her spectacles and began staring hard at the Here the Queen put on 3186
hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that up into 3600
hers that you have just been reading about and when she had of 3584
her still it was good practice to say it there was no one to listen to 274
her surprise got much evidence yet she said to herself Imagine 3336
her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the 904
her temper life before and she felt that she was losing 1303
her that she might as well look and see what behind it it occurred to 1148
her that she ought to have wondered at this afterwards it occurred to 232
her The Cat seemed to think that there she had some one to listen to 2349
her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kings noticing 2192
her then scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above 1053
her the other players and shouting Off with his head or Off with 2590
her they hurried resting in the shade however the moment they saw 2582
her They told me you had been to 3475
her though as they the question and they repeated their arguments to 2423
her to begin He should like to hear her repeat something now Tell 2963
her to carry it any further she felt that it would be quite absurd for 1673
her toes when they passed too close and waving their treading on 2844
her too much so she went on of living would be like but it puzzled 2025
her to speak first why your quite sure whether it was good manners for 1556
her to there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking about 3091
her to wink with one of its little eyes inquisitively and seemed to 571
her Treacle said a sleepy voice behind 3317
her tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with 3575
her tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that 1366

her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby ordering off 3610
he running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because 1468

her usual height succeeded in bringing herself down to 1443
her very earnestly Now Dinah tell me hand with Dinah and saying to 302
her very much at first but after appearance in the air it puzzled 2337
her very much crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding 3352
her violently with its wings was beating 1372
her voice and see that up into hersshe could hear the very tones of 3600
her voice close to her ear Youre thinking startled when she heard 2477
her voice Nobody Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of 3564
her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did repeat it but 499
her waiting Alice felt so Oh wont she be savage if Ive kept 471
her was another long she looked up but it was all dark overhead before 307
her watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all 3594
her way into a tidy little room with a table By this time she had found 934
her way out I shall be punished for it now I suppose by to find 553
her When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to 619
her with large round eyes and An enormous puppy was looking down at 1110

he said The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all 1830
he said to she had this fit you never had fits my dear I think 3538

He sent them word I had not gone 3480

he shook his grey locks In my youth said the sage as 1260
he shook off both his shoes which the wretched Hatter trembled so that 3220
He should like to hear her repeat something now Tell her to begin 2963
Hes murdering the time Off with his Queen jumped up and bawled out 1969
he sneezes And beat him when 1613
he sneezes I beat him when 1627

He unfolded the paper as he spoke nothing written on the outside 3438
He was an old crab he was though 2745
he was going a journey I should say With what porpoise told me 2932
he was gone and by the time The Cats head began fading away the moment 2446
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and know 1504
he wasnt going to begin at his time of life thing before and 2431
he wasnt one Alice asked Why did you call him Tortoise if 2670

He wont stand beating Ah that accounts for it said the Hatter 1929
he wore his crown over the The judge by the way was the King and as 3099
he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied anxiously round to see if 3248
he would not join the dance Said he thanked the whiting kindly but 2858

his mouth close to her ear and whispered Shes under sentence of 2283
his neighbour to tell him A nice stupid and that he had to ask 3128

his shoulder with some curiosity What a Alice had been looking over 1884
his shrill little voice when the White Rabbit read out at the top of 3337

his teacup instead of the confusion he bit a large piece out of 3194
his teaspoon to the March Hare it was at the great pointing with 1948
his The Footman seemed to consider this a good opportunity for repeating 1530
his throat said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and 2786
his time of life thing before and he wasnt going to begin at 2431
his toes the Mock Turtle persisted How could he turn But about 2999
his toes Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out 2979

quite a long argument with the known them all her life Indeed she had 644
quite a new idea to Alice and she thought over it a little This was 2764
quite as much as serpents do you child but little girls eat eggs 1421
quite as much use in the trial to herself I should think it would be 3369
quite as safe to stay with it as to on the whole she thought it would be 2619
quite a swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making 613

quite slowly All right said the Cat and this time it vanished 1771

quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes felt 1446
quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your 1556
quite surprised to find that she remained the same growing and she was 409
quite tired and out of breath and set off at once and ran till she was 1132

she could not possibly reach went back to the table for it she found 384
she could not remember ever having heard like the three gardeners but 2197
she could not saying Thank you sir for your interesting story but 2662
she could not see anything that the flowers and the blades of grass but 1144
she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers the pack 2217

she couldnt answer either Do bats eat cats for you see as 299

she could understand she said as politely as 1898
she cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and 357
shedding gallons of moment I tell you But she went on all the same 460
she decided on going After a while finding that nothing more happened 381
she decided to remain where she was as the court but on second thoughts 3200
shed have everybody executed all round It was this last than no time 2437
she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the mouth but 1349
She did it so quickly very soon found an opportunity of taking it away 3133
she did not at all know Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as 1693
she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything that 758
she did not get dry very soon sure she would catch a bad cold if 654
She did not get hold of anything hand and made a snatch in the air 1001
she did not like the look of executed for having missed their turns and 2401
she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well sharp chin However 2491
she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing was empty 259
she did not like to go nearer till she had was so large a house that 1783
she did not venture to say it out birthday presents like that But 2552
she did she picked up a little bit of stick and Hardly knowing what 1117
she did so and giving it a violent shake at sort of lullaby to it as 1609
She doesnt believe theres The jury all wrote down on their slates 3513
she do history 2647
she door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when 383
she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the tiny First 3598
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till 1051
she drew herself up and said very gravely I think short remarks and 1204
she dropped out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and 530
Shed soon fetch it back nobody in particular 862
sheepbells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice to the tinkling 3621
she every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while 1439
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and Oh I beg your pardon 3355
she fancied That you wont thought Alice and after waiting till 999
she fell past it 261
she fell very slowly for she had Either the well was very deep or 251
she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said 375
she felt a violent the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment 1340
she felt in the middle Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for 653
she felt She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but 1345
she felt sure it would all come Alice did not dare to disobey though 3008
she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further 1673
She felt that she question it didnt much matter which way she put it 300
she felt that she was losing her temper life before and 1303
she felt unhappy again no wonder 963
she felt very any more And here poor Alice began to cry again for 882
She felt very curious to know what it that curled all over their heads 1473
she first So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when 2951
she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here time 345
she found her head pressing against the ceiling drunk half the bottle 946
she found herself falling down what seemed about stopping herself before 246
she found herself in the long hall and close to the little Once more 2125
she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly all spoke at once 2424
she found she could not possibly reach went back to the table for it 384
she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she door 383
she found that her shoulders changed into alarm in another moment when 1355
she found this a very difficult question However at last she round 1335
she found to be nothing but the tops to dive in among the leaves which 1369
she found turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen 312
she gained courage as she went their eyes and mouths so very wide but 2954
she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and her 3574
she gave her Alice looked down at them and considered a little before 2911
She gave me a good character 3477
she gave one sharp kick and waited to saying to herself This is Bill 1054
She generally rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute 391
she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a When 2417
she got into the her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before 3301
she got thought Alice I might as well be at school at once However 2971
she got to the into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when 382
she got to the part about on Her listeners were perfectly quiet till 2955
She got up and went to the table to measure growing small again 527
she got up in This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear 2109
she got used to it in a few minutes felt quite strange at first but 1446
she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there and 961
she had accidentally upset the week before of a globe of goldfish 3353
She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be passion 2400
she had asked it Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if 1330
she had a vague sort of idea the goldfish kept running in her head and 3357
she had been anything near the right size that it It was so long since 1445
she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made of the trees under which 1370
she had brought herself down to nine inches high house till 1456
she had but to open them again and all would change to though she knew 3618
she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight By the time 2411
she had Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for 251
she had expected before she had It did so indeed and much sooner than 945
she had felt quite unhappy at the thing she said to herself for 2610
she had forgotten the little golden key and when she door she found 383
she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table By this time 934
she had found the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before 920
she had gone through that day the number of changes 1412
she had got her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as 2311
she had got its head down and was going to out laughing and when 2315
she had grown in the last few minutes and she the moment how large 3349
she had grown so large in If any of them can explain it said Alice 3508
she had grown to her full size by Who cares for you said Alice 3567
she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs in the window and on it as 935
she had hurt Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that 580
she had It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before 945
she had left her leaning her head BUT her sister sat still just as 3593
she had looked under it and on both sides of it and herself and when 1147
she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to As soon as 1647
She had neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent 1367
she had never been so much contradicted in all her Alice said nothing 1302
she had never before seen a rabbit with either a her mind that 236
she had never done such a thing before but way of speaking to a mouse 568
she had never heard before Sure then Im here Digging then a voice 1007
she had never seen such a curious croquetground in began Alice thought 2301
she had not as yet had any Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure 2329
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of 1780
she had nothing else to do and Alice thought she might as well wait as 1227
she had not long to doubt A barrowful of what thought Alice But 1078
she had not noticed before and round she came upon a low curtain 326
she had not the smallest idea arranged the only difficulty was that 1105
she had of hers that you have just been reading about and when 3584
she had other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until 1442
she had Page word as added to the text just as 3669
she had put Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste 3365
she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while that 525
she had quite a long argument with the known them all her life Indeed 644
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a little 2476
she had read Alice had never been in a court of justice before but 3094
she had read several see whether its marked poison or not for 352
she had sat down with her face in her hands Alice said nothing 2991
she had she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that 542
she had sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice 218
she had some one to listen to her The Cat seemed to think that there 2349
she had this fit Before 3496
she had this fit you never had fits my dear I think he said to 3538
she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing and when 387
she had to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if 643
she had to run back into the wood Alice laughed so much at this that 1485
she had to stop and untwist it After a while she every now and then 1439
she had was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till 1783
she had wept when she made out that she was in the pool of tears which 549
she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came Quadrille that 2973
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming It was the White 467
She hastily put and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken 947
she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was 1052
she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and After a time 466
she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass but 1002
she heard her voice close to her ear Youre thinking startled when 2477
she heard quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes 985
she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way Just then 557
she heard the Queens voice in the distance screaming with on as 2399
she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her 1000
she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill The first thing 1057
she helped herself to Alice did not quite know what to say to this so 2040
she his fan and glovesthat is if I can find them As she said this 916
she hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the shelves as 257
she hurried out of the room The cook threw croquet with the Queen and 1637
she if people had to lie down upon their faces procession thought 2199
she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to herself How fond 2506
she is only a child 2230
She is such a dear quiet take a fancy to cats if you could only see her 588
she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes washing her faceand 591
she Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as 1222
she is you know Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia and 285
she It grunted again so violently that 188
she jumped up on to her feet in a moment Alice was not a bit hurt and 306
she kept on at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad And 778
she kept tossing While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song 1622
she knelt down and looked along the passage much larger than a rathole 331
she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to though 3618
she knew that it might happen any minute dispute with the Queen but 2330
she knew that were of the same age as thinking over all the children 484
she knew the about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that 3095
she knew to the Gryphon and all the other queer noises would change 3623
she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying children 1679
she knows such a be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she oh 489
she leant And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as 1135
she led into the garden Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom 2128
she let the Dormouse go on for This answer so confused poor Alice that 2084
she liked them best Dont let him know 3500
she likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying So 565
she listened or seemed would always get into her eyesand still as 3602
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it 870
Shell get me executed as sure as ferrets paws Oh my fur and whiskers 899
shell think me No itll never do to ask perhaps ignorant little girl 288
she longed to get out of into the loveliest garden you ever saw How 332
she looked down at her feet they seemed to Goodbye feet for when 430
she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see As she said this 524
she looked down into Illustration It grunted again so violently that 1684
she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there could that 1671
she looked down was were nowhere to be found all she could see when 1356
she looked up and there was the Cat it was in March As she said this 1763
she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long 307
she looked up little pattering of footsteps in the distance and 884
she looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and 897
shelves as she hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the 257
she made her next remark Then the eleventh day must have been a before 2765
she made it out to be a grin and she said watching it a minute or two 2338
she made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when 549
she made out the words Wheres the other talking together 1035
she made out what it was she was beginning to her a good deal until 3198
she made some tarts The Queen of Hearts 3144
she meant to take Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if 1602
she might Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well 3587
she might as well go back and see how the game was going Alice thought 2398
she might as well look and see what behind it it occurred to her that 1148
she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and Alice thought 1227
she might find another key on it or at back to the table half hoping 343
she might well say this to go on crying in this way Stop this you 459
she much wanted to know What is a Caucusrace said Alice not that 704
she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse But 743
she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue dreadful 1527
She nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break 2638
she neither of the others took the least notice of her going though 2111
she never knew things at all as the game was in such confusion that 2402
she next peeped out the for fear of their hearing her and when 1486
she noticed a curious could get away without being seen when 2336
she noticed Not at all said Alice shes so extremely Just then 2365
she noticed that one of the trees had a door Just as she said this 2120
she of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one Why 729
she oh she knows such a be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and 489
she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words 401
she opened the door and went in perfectly idiotic And 1539
she ought And when I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now 972
she ought not to lie down on her face Alice was rather doubtful whether 2196
she ought to have wondered at this afterwards it occurred to her that 232
shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the of the 3622
she picked her At any rate Ill never go there again said Alice as 2116
she picked up a little bit of stick and Hardly knowing what she did 1117
she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers Lastly 3627
she put her hand in her Alice had no idea what to do and in despair 733
she put it She felt that she question it didnt much matter which way 300
she put one arm out Still she went on growing and as a last resource 956
she put them into a large You shant be beheaded said Alice and 2256
she question it didnt much matter which way she put it She felt that 300
she quite forgot how to speak good surprised that for a moment 428
she rabbit I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next And 926
she ran across the field after it and was just in time to curiosity 238
she ran as well she might Alice got up and ran off thinking while 3587
she ran but the Gryphon only What trial is it Alice panted as 3067
she ran How He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as 914
she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself appeared but 1096
she ran off at a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that 910
she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little the door 1092
she ran with all speed back to the little door now for the garden and 535
she remained the same growing and she was quite surprised to find that 409
she remarked I dont see any wine 1812
she remarked It tells the day of the month and doesnt funny watch 1885
she remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar A mouseof 569
she remembered how small it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then 559
she remembered IIm a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as 1411
she remembered trying to box her own ears for having eyes and once 394
she repeated Alice was thoroughly puzzled Does the boots and shoes 2905
she repeated aloud 1508
she round she found this a very difficult question However at last 1335
she said aloud I must be getting many miles Ive fallen by this time 269
she said and not going to do that in a hurry No Ill look first 351
She said animals and some were birds I suppose they are the jurors 3105
she said as politely as she could understand 1898
she said by way as she could The games going on rather better now 2492
she said for her hair goes in such long Im sure Im not Ada 487
she said it out again and put it right not that it signifies much 3368
She said it to the at her and the Queen said severely Who is this 2204
she said than wasting it asking riddles with no answers time 1916
she said the Gryphon Its all her fancy that they never Why 2628
She said the last words out loud and the little thing it behind 1652
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite 1561
she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash As 541
she said this she came suddenly upon an that to be done I wonder As 1451
she said this she his fan and glovesthat is if I can find them As 916
she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see As 524
she said this she looked up and there was the Cat it was in March As 1763
she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door Just as 2120
she said to herself Alice had been to the seaside once in railway 544
she said to herself and nibbled a little of And now which is which 1339
she said to herself and shouted out Youd better not do that again 1081
she said to herself as she ran How He took me for his housemaid 914
she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the thing 2610
she said to herself glass table Now Ill manage better this time 2126
she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his 1506
she said to herself Imagine her surprise got much evidence yet 3336
she said to herself in a melancholy I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah 879
she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone When Im a Duchess 2467
she said to name of nearly everything there Thats the judge 3096
she said to one of the officers just as the Dormouse crossed the court 3218
she said to trot quietly away into the wood If it had grown up 1676
she said watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and 2338
she said without even looking round Off with his head 2393
shes And shes such a Page she changed to 3654
she sat coming Theres plenty of room said Alice indignantly and 1806
she sat down and began to cry again hopeless than ever 456
she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland So 3617
she sat still and said help thinking there must be more to come so 2663
she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby jumped but 1562
she saw maps and pictures cupboards and bookshelves here and there 256
she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse into the last time 2113
she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her sometimes 393
she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers head Those whom 2591
she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it So 1675
she set to work and very soon finished off the cake So 415
she set to work nibbling at the mushroom she led into the garden Then 2128
she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the 1441
she She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether 2335
she shook the the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till 990
she should chance to be If I or 3490
she should meet the knocking and hurried up stairs in great fear lest 919
she should push the matter on If 3482
she should push the matter onthat must be the courseIf 3529
she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she to say 759
Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here 2443
she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and pool and 590
she something out of a bottle They all made a rush at Alice the moment 1095
she soon found about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly 529
She soon got tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move 3367
she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had she was now and 560
she soon of lodging houses and behind them a railway station However 548
she So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that 1090
she spoke 2486
she spoke but no result seemed to follow She was moving them about as 1362
she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in ground as 2572
she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling tried to curtsey as 286
she spoke I must go and get ready to play flinging the baby at her as 1636
she spoke The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his as 3542
she spread out her all Do as I tell you you coward and at last 1026
she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as you can find it And 2485
shes she and Im I andoh dear how very little Besides 490
shes so extremely Just then she noticed Not at all said Alice 2365
shes such a capital one for catching mice you Dinahs our cat And 868
shes such a Page she changed to shes And 3654
shes the best tone Nobody seems to like her down here and Im sure 880
she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and remembered that 1440
she stood looking at the house and FOR a minute or two 1466
she stood still where she was and so that they couldnt see it So 2200
she stood things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as 2166
she stopped Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but 3120
She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the 1151
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under 2310
she suddenly spread out her she heard the Rabbit just under the window 1000
Shes under sentence of his mouth close to her ear and whispered 2283
she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she So 1090
she swam about trying I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as 552
she swam lazily about in the thing Alice went on half to herself as 589
she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought off and 558
shes washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand 591
she that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so 1346
she The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked goodnatured 1687
she the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and 3349
she This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so 1131
she thought and hand round the refreshments But get the trial done 3090
she thought and how funny itll seem sending go by the carrier 440
she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any 1661
she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her it for 3107
she thought at first she would get up and leave grow larger again and 3199
she thought But leading right into it Thats very curious 2121
she thought I must be she was talking How can I have done that 526
she thought it must be the right house because the the March Hare 1781
she thought it over dear Oh dear I shall be too late when 231
she thought its sure to make head If I eat one of these cakes 1086
she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to on the whole 2619
she thought off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first 558
she thought over it a little This was quite a new idea to Alice and 2764
she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so 1688
she thought there was no use in Alice was more and more puzzled but 1388
she thought till its ears have come or at least one speaking to it 2346
she thought to herself but it doesnt matter a bit 3399
she through that little door into that lovely garden First however 373
she tipped over the jurybox with the jumped up in such a hurry that 3350
she to her lips I know something interesting is sure to happen 940
she to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when 1680
she told her Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and 3582
she too began dreaming after a fashion and wonderful Adventures till 3595
she took courage and went on again and not to her so 1563
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she hung upon pegs 257
she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves of tiny white kid gloves 936
she to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as 759
she trembled till she shook the the Rabbit coming to look for her and 990
she tried another question Alice felt that this could not be denied so 1709
she tried hard to whistle to thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and 1112
she tried her it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and 385
she tried the behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high 327
she tried the effect of lying down with was not even room for this and 954
she tried to fancy what the flame of a what I should be like then And 377
she tried to look down and make out was going to happen next First 253
she tucked her arm affectionately dear old thing said the Duchess as 2460
she tucked it under her arm that it might not escape of the ground So 2414
she turned away unpleasant state of mind 1213
she uncorked it and put it with the words DRINK ME but nevertheless 939
she ventured to go on again Twentyfour not seem to be listening so 1604
she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but gloves and 902
she very seldom followed it and gave herself very good advice though 392
she very soon finished it off hot buttered toast 364
She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a 1033
she waited go after that savage Queen so 2620
she waited patiently But 2654
she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself then 2130
she walked off leaving Alice alone executions I have ordered and 2617
she walked on in the direction in appear and after a minute or two 1759
she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to door 318
she walked up towards it rather to about two feet high even then 1785
she wandered The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as 1099
she wanted there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever 2318
she wants to know your This here young lady said the Gryphon 2646
she was about a foot high had kept a piece of it in her pocket till 2129
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt 1345
She was a little nervous about it just at first saw the White Rabbit 2952
she was always ready to talk about her pet Alice replied eagerly for 867
she was and so that they couldnt see it So she stood still where 2200
she was appealed to by all three to settle The moment Alice appeared 2422
she was as the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where 3200
she was beginning to her a good deal until she made out what it was 3198
she was beginning to Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for 2558
She was close behind it when she whiskers how late its getting 311
she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she what 254
she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the So 223
she was ever to door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how 318
she was exactly the right Duchess was very ugly and secondly because 2489
she was getting so used to queer Alice was not much surprised at this 1746
she was going to shrink any further waited for a few minutes to see if 374
she was holding and she dropped out that the cause of this was the fan 530
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she made out that 549
She was Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side 2276
she was Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact 450
She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she 2335
she was looking at the place where it had been things happening While 1747
she was losing her temper life before and she felt that 1303
She was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow 1362
she was near enough to look over their slates Alice could see this as 3398
she was not Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for 1555
she was now about a thousand times as large house quite forgetting that 991
she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had 560
she was now herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess 528
she was now only ten inches high and her face And so it was indeed 371
she was now the right size for going brightened up at the thought that 372
she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him the last few minutes that 3509
she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were 3104
she was out of sight then it chuckled What fun said the Gryphon 2623
she was peering about anxiously among how to set about it and while 1106
she was playing against herself cheated herself in a game of croquet 395
she was quite pleased to find that she knew the about them in books and 3095
she was quite silent for a This was such a new idea to Alice that 1427
she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same growing and 409
she was quite tired and out of breath and set off at once and ran till 1132
she was rather glad their heads downwards The Antipathies I think 282
she was ready to ask help of any one so when the desperate that 472
she was saying and the words came Quadrille that she hardly knew what 2973
she was shrinking rapidly so she that there was no time to be lost as 1346
she was small enough to get through began shrinking directly As soon as 1091
she was so much CURIOUSER and curiouser cried Alice 427
she was surprised to find quite a When she got back to the Cheshire Cat 2417
she was talking How can I have done that she thought I must be 526
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it it but 1113
she was to get out again in the world 242
she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that she had 542
she was walking hand in was dozing off and had just begun to dream that 301
she went down to look about her and to wonder what plenty of time as 252
she went hunting about and Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as 907
she went in 2123
she went in search of her hedgehog whether it was her turn or not So 2403
She went in without plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it 918
she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she and 2145
she went on all the same shedding gallons of moment I tell you But 460
she went on And how Alice didnt think that proved it at all however 1725
she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out Still 956
She went on growing and growing Alas it was too late to wish that 952
she went on I must be Mabel after all and filled with tears again as 513
she went on in a trembling voice wrong and 3009
she went on of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so 2025
she went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must And 439
she went on taking first one side and then the other and making And so 984
she went on talking Dear dear How kept fanning herself all the time 478
she went on that the Queen was close behind her listening so 2366
she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule 2470
she went on What have you been doing turning to the rosetree 2242
she went on Whats your name child Alice 2208
she went on Would you Come its pleased so far thought Alice and 1695
she went out but it just missed her a fryingpan after her as 1638
she went round the court and got behind him and could not stand and 3132
she went slowly Everybody says come on here thought Alice as 2631
she went their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as 2954
she went There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so 342
she were looking over their shoulders Alice could see as well as if 3125
she were saying lessons and began to crossed her hands on her lap as if 498
she what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then 254
she what would become of me Theyre dreadfully and then thought 2331
she which the March Hare was said to live Ive seen hatters before 1760
she whiskers how late its getting She was close behind it when 311
she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon sure 654
she would feel even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how 3632
she would gather about her other little children childhood and how 3630
she would get up and leave grow larger again and she thought at first 3199
she would have was in livery otherwise judging by his face only 1469

slippery best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too 386
slowly All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite 1771
slowly back again and IT was the White Rabbit trotting 896
slowly back to her When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam 619
slowly Everybody says come on here thought Alice as she went 2631
slowly followed her back to the much frightened to say a word but 2578
slowly forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very 2845

small cake on which the words she opened it and found in it a very 401
small donations array of equipment including outdated equipment Many 3996
small enough to get through began shrinking directly As soon as she was 1091
smaller and being ordered about by mice and always growing larger and 966
smaller I can creep under the door so either way Ill makes me grow 404

smallest idea arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the 1105
smallest notice of her or of smoking a long hookah and taking not the 1154
small for a baby altogether Alice did not eyes were getting extremely 1659
small it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how 559
small ones choked and had to be patted on the back theirs and the 764
small passage not Alice opened the door and found that it led into a 330
small staff outside the United States US laws alone swamp our 4016
small The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or 2392
smiled and passed on The Queen 2369
smiled in reply Knave of Hearts who only bowed and 2205
smile some of the other birds the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a 698
smile There was a dead silence with a 3548
smiling at everything that was said and went by without nervous manner 2191
smiling jaws With gently 510
smoke from The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of 1541
smoking again hookah into its mouth and began 1318
smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of 1154
snail but come and join the dance Then turn not pale beloved 2865
snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance But the 2857
snail Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a 2848
snappishly Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster 859
snatch in the air She did not get hold of anything hand and made a 1001
snatch in the air This time there were hand again and made another 1027
sneeze a moments pause The only things in the kitchen that did not 1551
sneezed There was certainly too much of it in the air Even the Duchess 1549
sneeze of the baby the shriek of the of the shepherd boyand the 3622
sneezes And beat him when he 1613
sneezes I beat him when he 1627
sneezing all at once court by the way the people near the door began 3302
sneezing and every now and then going on withina constant howling and 1496
sneezing and howling alternately without occasionally and the baby was 1550
sneezing as well as she could for 1547
sneezing by this time Dont grunt grunted in reply it had left off 1653
sneezing on the Duchess knee while plates and dishes crashed was 3611
snorting like a starfish thought Alice The poor little thing was 1642
snout than a real nose also its very turnup nose much more like a 1658
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first 2951
soand what with the and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week or 3226
sobbed again or grunted it was impossible now The poor little thing 1666
sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the though still 2667
sobbing like the look of the thing at all But perhaps it was only 1660
sobbing of the Mock Turtle Alice was very nearly getting up and heavy 2661
So Bills got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to Oh 1046
sob Ive tried every way and nothing seems and added with a kind of a 1379
sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a bone in for a minute or two 2785
sobs in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles heavy 3625
sobs of the miserable Mock filled the air mixed up with the distant 3614
sobs The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice choked with 3037
So dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late 3586
softly after it Mouse dear Do come back again and we So she called 616
soft thing to nurseand shes washing her faceand she is such a nice 591

soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran 2253
soldiers shouted Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the 2263
soldiers the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or 2217
soldiers wandered about for a flowerpot that stood near The three 2257
soldiers were always to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup 2319
soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was The 2268
solemn as she to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as 759
solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and then So they began 2843
solemnly It does the boots and shoes the Gryphon replied very 2903
solemnly rising to its feet I move that In that case said the Dodo 692
solemnly Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo 753
solemn Queen to play croquet The FrogFootman repeated in the same 1479
solemn tone For the Duchess An invitation from the saying in a 1478
Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather impatiently 2919

somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as 260
somehow fallen into the sea and in that case I can go back by 543
Some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant 3397
Some of the This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party 872

Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied F 3924

something splashing about in the pool a little way Just then she heard 557
something wasnt done about it in less The Queens argument was that if 2436
something worth hearing For some perhaps after all it might tell her 1228

sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her 393
sometimes shorter until she had other and growing sometimes taller and 1442
sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had other and growing 1442

So she likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying 565
So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland 3617
So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it 1675
So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake 415
So she stood still where she was and so that they couldnt see it 2200
So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she 1090
So she tucked it under her arm that it might not escape of the ground 2414
So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the 223
So she went in search of her hedgehog whether it was her turn or not 2403

There isnt any said the March Hare 1814
There is such a nice little dog near answer so Alice went on eagerly 605
There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went on 1501
There ought to be a book written about me that there middle of one 971
Theres a great Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted 3151
theres a large mustardmine near here And everything that Alice said 2526

theres any one fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that 2332
Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail 2849
Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself 1546
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went 342
theres half my plan done and began talking to herself as usual Come 1447
theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person Why 398
theres hardly room for you and no room at all lessons in here Why 981
theres It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact 3437
Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White 3423
theres no harm in trying So she likely it can talk at any rate 565

theres no one with such a neck as that No no Youre a serpent and 1416
Theres no pleasing them serpents 1386
theres no room to grow up any more added in a sorrowful tone at least 973
Theres no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the 2047
theres no use in crying like that said Alice to herself Come 390
Theres no use in knocking said the Footman and that for two 1492
theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately hes Oh 1538
Theres plenty of room said Alice indignantly and she sat coming 1806
theres the confusing it is all the things being alive for instance 2356
theres The jury all wrote down on their slates She doesnt believe 3513
The rest next time It is next time 116
There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I 1073
There was a dead silence with a smile 3548
There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really 3456
There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as 1146
There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers 1024
There was a sound of many footsteps themselves flat upon their faces 2180
THERE was a table set out under a tree in front of the 1797
There was certainly too much of it in the air Even the Duchess sneezed 1549
There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out 3472
There was exactly one got into it and handed them round as prizes 735
There was no label this time bottle that stood near the lookingglass 938
There was no One two three and along the course here and there 714
There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and 309
There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began Down down down 291
There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it 229
There was some attempt at the newspapers at the end of trials 3272
There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when 316
There will be nonsense in it 101
These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an 2659
The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was 2268
The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at 1804
THE TARTS XI WHO STOLE 161
The three soldiers wandered about for a flowerpot that stood near 2257
The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave voice until 3361
The trials beginning was heard in the to repeat it when a cry of 3061
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates What are they 3111
The twinkling of what said the King 3229
The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his as she spoke 3542
The wells of fancy dry 113
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles Where shall I begin please 3466
They all can said the Duchess and most of em do 1568
They all crowded round it panting and 177
They all crowded round it panting and asking 738
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she something out of a bottle 1095
They all returned from him to you 3487
They all sat down at once in a large ring with the Mouse dry enough 652
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance 2851
They cant have anything to all doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon 3112
They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently remarked theyd 2019
theyd good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish 3089
theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people that 931
theyd take the wonder what they will do next If they had any sense 1074
theyd They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently remarked 2019
They had a large canvas bag which tied explain to you how it was done 3267
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance 2636
They have their tails in I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully 2882
They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or 2016
theyll all think me at think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave 264
theyll do cucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what 1029

theyre about even know what 3462
theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say 1425
theyre all over crumbs their mouthsand 2883
theyre both mad Hare Visit either you like 1714

Theyre done with blacking I believe answer 2912
Theyre dreadfully and then thought she what would become of me 2331
theyre like seen them so often of course you know what 2880
theyre making such a noise inside no one could secondly because 1494
theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the queerest thing No 3443
theyre only a pack of cards after but she added to herself Why 2211
Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply 3117
theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave 1651
They told me you had been to her 3475
theyve Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice Im glad 1833
They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun If 2613
THEY were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on 637

think And oh I wish you could see her after the birds Why cant 869
think And she began thinking over other rather a handsome pig I 1678

think dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to 245
think for you see Alice had learnt several thousand miles down I 271

think I could if I only knew how to begin shut up like a telescope I 337
think I may as well go in at once And everythings curious today I 2122
think I must have been changed I was when I got up this morning but I 1173
Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little 2555
thinking a minute or They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after 2016
thinking I Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was 1401
thinking it was over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice 1123

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she 1131
This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again 1218

though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to 3618
though she neither of the others took the least notice of her going 2111
though she very seldom followed it and gave herself very good advice 392

thought and hand round the refreshments But get the trial done she 3090
thought and how funny itll seem sending go by the carrier she 440
thought and it said in a its face was quite pale with passion Alice 620
thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any she 1661
thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her it for she 3107
thought at first she would get up and leave grow larger again and she 3199
thought At last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill 1063
thought But leading right into it Thats very curious she 2121
thought decidedly uncivil But perhaps he cant help it this Alice 1505
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying Alice remained looking 1333
thoughtfully but thenI That would be grand certainly said Alice 1938
thoughtfully I It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated 2962
thoughtfully They have their tails in I believe so Alice replied 2882
Though they were mine before 3488
though this things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and 272
thought I must be she was talking How can I have done that she 526
thought it had some kind of authority looked at the Gryphon as if he 2964
thought it must be the right house because the the March Hare she 1781
thought it over dear Oh dear I shall be too late when she 231
thought its sure to make head If I eat one of these cakes she 1086
thought it would Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and 1575
thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to on the whole she 2619
thought it would said the Cat and vanished again I 1756
thought off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she 558
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks 1859
thought over it a little This was quite a new idea to Alice and she 2764
thought poor Alice it doorway and even if my head would go through 335
thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people But its no use now 397
thought poor Alice when one wasnt It was much pleasanter at home 965
thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in began Alice 2301
thought she if people had to lie down upon their faces procession 2199
thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going Alice 2398
thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and Alice 1227
thought she what would become of me Theyre dreadfully and then 2331
thoughts she decided to remain where she was as the court but on second 3200
thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she 1688
thoughts were still running If Id been the whiting said Alice whose 2922
thought that it it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the 1113
thought that she was now the right size for going brightened up at the 372
thought that somebody ought to speak but the Dodo had paused as if it 705
thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never 538
thought there was no use in Alice was more and more puzzled but she 1388
thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave Alice 757
thought they were nice grand words to was or Longitude either but 277
thought this a very curious thing it busily painting them red Alice 2144
thought this must be the right of swimming about here O Mouse Alice 567
thought This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of 721
thought till its ears have come or at least one speaking to it she 2346
thought to herself but it doesnt matter a bit she 3399
thought to herself How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice 2506
thought to herself I There was a dead silence instantly and Alice 1073
thought to herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily 1314
thought to So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice 2652
thought you did said the Mouse I proceed Edwin and Morcar I 670
though you maynt believe it Yes we went to school in the sea 2681
thousand miles down I think for you see Alice had learnt several 271
thousand times as large house quite forgetting that she was now about a 991
three and along the course here and there There was no One two 714
three blasts on the trumpet and then On this the White Rabbit blew 3141
three Call the first witness said the King and the Rabbit blew 3154
three dates on their slates and then added them up and down all 3173
three gardeners And who are these said the Queen pointing to the 2214
three gardeners at the roses growing on it were white but there were 2143
three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard like the 2197
three gardeners instantly threw out The Queen The Queen and the 2179
three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the 2184
three Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the 2237
three inches high itself upright as it spoke it was exactly 1311
three inches is such a wretched height to be mind said Alice 1308
Three In such an hour Ah cruel 91
threelegged stool in one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a 1542
threelegged table all made of solid Suddenly she came upon a little 321
three little sisters the Dormouse began Once upon a time there were 2009
three little sistersthey were learning to draw go on And so these 2056
three many more than 1822
three of her own children or courtiers or 2218
three of the Off with their heads and the procession moved on 2252
three of the players to be passion She had already heard her sentence 2400
three or more You gave us 3486

very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it There was nothing so 229
very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he a 3390
very rude severity its 1828
very sadly jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again 2829
Very said Alice wheres the Duchess 2279
very seldom followed it and gave herself very good advice though she 392

very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of hot day made her feel 224
very sleepy and they drew all manner of its eyes for it was getting 2088

very soon finished off the cake So she set to work and 415
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away She did it so quickly 3133

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and 907

very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its 1658
very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right Duchess was 2489
very uncomfortable and as there and she grew no larger still it was 961
Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse thought Alice only as head 1801
very uncomfortable while all the rest were quite silent and looked 2420
very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any Alice began to feel 2329
very well as pigs and was just saying children she knew who might do 1679

went commotion in the pool as it 614
went down to look about her and to wonder what plenty of time as she 252

went their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she 2954
went The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and 3260

When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her 619
When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon 3015
When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked 2203
When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark 2980
When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea 2856

where she was and so that they couldnt see it So she stood still 2200
where she was as the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain 3200
wheres the Duchess Very said Alice 2279
Wheres the other talking together she made out the words 1035
whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off held it out to the puppy 1118
wherever she wanted there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way 2318
wherever you go her life and had come to the general conclusion that 545

whether its marked poison or not for she had read several see 352
whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your quite sure 1556
whether it was her turn or not So she went in search of her hedgehog 2403
whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider 1694
whether she ought not to lie down on her face Alice was rather doubtful 2196
whether she She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering 2335
whether the blows hurt it or not that it was quite impossible to say 1582
whether the pleasure of hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid 224
whether they were gardeners or soldiers the pack she could not tell 2217
whether youre a little girl or a serpent me 1430
whether youre nervous or not executed 3223
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation 1202

while Alice conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute 1858
while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable 2420
while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time all the 2324
while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going After a 381
while finishing the game likely to win that its hardly worth 2367
while however she again heard a lonely and lowspirited In a little 883
while in silence to say which and they went on for some 1667
while King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it 2448
While little hands make vain pretence 88
while more and more faintly answered Come on and ran the faster 3068
while plates and dishes crashed was sneezing on the Duchess knee 3611
whiles and weve no time to wash the things between 1981
While she be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation 1576
while she every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a 1439
while she ran as well she might Alice got up and ran off thinking 3587
While she was looking at the place where it had been things happening 1747
while she was peering about anxiously among how to set about it and 1106
While Tertia interrupts the tale 102
while that she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves 525
while the Dodo solemnly Then they all crowded round her once more 753
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing 1622
while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowly forepaws to mark the time 2845
while the Mouse was speaking so that her idea of the puzzling about it 779
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat 3014
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl 3017
